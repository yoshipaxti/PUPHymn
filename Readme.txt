FOR THE BEST COMPATIBILITY

1.Use a 1920x1080 Screen (or zoom out (using ctrl+scrolldown or up for zoom in) if the contents look a little too cluttered)
2. Use Google Chrome as the browser 


FOR AUTOPLAY

1. Enable microphone usage on a website, click the "allow" button that appears as a notification when the HTML opens. This is an alternative method to enable autoplay in browsers since most updated browsers do not allow autoplay due to bad user experiences.
